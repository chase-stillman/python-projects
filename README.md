This repository is a showcase of some Python projects I have worked on throughout my tenure at West Chester University whilst studying Computer Science. The projects were both personal and others used for Unversity level work, nonetheless improving my programming skills with extensive practice in logic and basic computational mathematicss.
The projects also aided me in utilizing a variety of Python/programming methods and gave me great practice in specifically creating my own methods. For future projects I hope to work with teams developing cutting-edge research in AI, assisted learning, chatbots, and much more.
